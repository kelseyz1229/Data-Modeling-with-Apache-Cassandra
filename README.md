# Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra

In this project, you'll apply what you've learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, you will need to model your data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. You are provided with part of the ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.
